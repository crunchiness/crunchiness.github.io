        <p>This is my first (hopefully of many) series of posts and this is my first post.</p>

        <p>
            In this series I will attempt to explain
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/crunchiness/lernd">Lernd</a> - my implementation of
            <span title="differential inductive logic programming">&part;ILP</span> framework by
            <a href="#bib01">(Evans & Grefenstette, 2018)</a> from DeepMind. If you are an AI researcher, you may have
            heard about it when it came out, but otherwise, I don't think it was the <em>bestest</em>, most important
            paper that came out from DeepMind. It did, however, catch my attention at the time. I was just beginning to
            think of going back to academia and thought that maybe the intersection between classic ML (probabilistic /
            NN-based) and symbolic AI is where it's at. While it's obviously a lengthy and quite technical paper, I
            found it very interesting. Moreover, I already knew about
            <span title="inductive logic programming">ILP</span> from some course in
            <span title="The University of Edinburgh">university</span> (cannot pinpoint which one exactly...). However,
            it was complicated enough as to confuse me, while still <em>seeming</em> understandable. So I decided to go
            ahead and implement it! Now, I'm pretty sure I understand it (and even have ideas for similar things), but
            to cement my understanding, I will try to explain everything in this series of posts. As they say, you only
            <em>really</em> know things that you can teach.
        </p>

        <h4>Target audience</h4>
        <p>
            Of course, I have to assume some level of skill and understanding in my audience, so I'm imagining my
            younger self, before me learnt about ILP. So basically, <b>anyone even remotely in the field of CS & AI</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the next post, I will probably try to explain the abstract and what ILP is.
